# PDF Book Reader: Flutter App to Manage and Read PDFs

PDFBookReader is a Flutter app that helps you manage a personal library of PDFs. You add books in PDF format and read them directly in the app. The focus is on a clean reading experience, fast access, and simple library management. This project brings together Dart, Flutter, and reliable PDF viewing capabilities to deliver a smooth, offline-friendly reading experience.

Optional hero visuals help users grasp the app's purpose at a glance. The design centers on readability, quick navigation, and a calm, distraction-free interface. The app provides a library view, a reader view, and a few helper screens to manage your documents. You can tap a book to open it, jump to a page, zoom in or out, and resume where you left off. The app stores metadata locally so you can browse your collection even when offline. The goal is to keep a lightweight footprint while delivering a reliable reading experience across platforms.

About this project
PDFBookReader is a portable library for PDFs crafted with Flutter. The app is built to be robust, readable, and easy to extend. It targets developers who want a solid, runnable Flutter project that demonstrates how to integrate PDF viewing, local storage, and simple library management. The project emphasizes practical patterns over novelty. It favors clear structure, well-documented code, and a straightforward feature set that can evolve over time.

Why it exists
Reading is a daily habit for many people. A dedicated PDF reader that doubles as a library manager helps keep documents organized. The app aims to be a reliable tool for students, researchers, and professionals who collect PDFs for later reading. It provides essential features without overwhelming the user. The goal is to offer a solid baseline that can be extended with new views, advanced search, annotations, and cross-device synchronization.

How it works
The app uses Flutter as the UI layer and Dart for business logic. A lightweight data layer stores metadata about each PDF in a local database. The PDF rendering is accomplished via a Flutter PDF library, exposing a comfortable reading experience with zoom, navigation, and rendering quality options. The UI presents two primary views: Library View and Reader View. In Library View, you browse and manage your PDFs. In Reader View, you read the selected PDF with controls for navigation, zoom, and bookmarks. The app is designed to gracefully handle missing files or moved assets by updating the library metadata when possible and by offering fallback options.
